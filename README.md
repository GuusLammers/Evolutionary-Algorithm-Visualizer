# Evolutionary-Algorithm-Visualizer
An interactive tool used to visualize an evolutionary algorithm implemented using the MVC design pattern.

# What I Learnt
- Used the MVC design pattern to decouple the model's and view's logic.
- Implemented a evolutionary algorithm where small dots try to find a goal while avoiding the edges of the screen and obstacles placed by the user.
- Allows user to specify the dots start position, the goal position, and the placement and size of however many obstacles the user wants.
- Refined Java and OOP skills.

# User Instructions
